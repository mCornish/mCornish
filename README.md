## About me
I've been building stuff on the web since 2011. I tend to build with TypeScript, React, and Next.js, but I've worked with many different stacks over the years.

I'm currently intrigued by the many applications of LLMs and the missteps being taken along the way.

In my free time I make music, art, and perform improv comedy.

## Current projects
- 🎮 Developing an out-of-sight rhythm game called Groove Hero
- ✍🏾 Creating an LLM-powered journaling app
